# MG08/15

A big old WW1 Maschinengewehr,with a working charging handle
belt fed open bolt action and unique recoil(with gas after shooting)
such a giant toy which I don't recommend you bringing it into TnH mode

Mod Includes:

1、The gun it self (spawn with a belt box)

2、Mag drum

3、A weird icon that doesn't do anything


Only issues:

have some little incorrect belt display.
(This will be fixed,but won't effect normal gaming so far)
